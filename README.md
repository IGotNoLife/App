	<h2>Fortnite</h2>
				<p> What Is Fortnite Battle Royale?
				Like other battle royale games, Fortnite Battle Royale is a competitive shooter between 100 players as they air-drop out of a moving plane (or “battle bus”, in this case),
				then fight to survive as the play space slowly shrinks to force people into combat.
				True to the battle royale formula, you need to find all of your weapons and equipment on the map — you don’t land with anything other than a pickaxe..</p>
